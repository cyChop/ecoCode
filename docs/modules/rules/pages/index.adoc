= üìú ecoCode rules

== Rules references

Web-oriented rules were based on:

* The book _Ecoconception Web / Les 115 bonnes pratiques_ (https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices[open source repo with the best practices])
* https://gr491.isit-europe.org/en/[GR491, Handbook of a sustainable design of digital services]
* https://ecoresponsable.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/referentiel-general-ecoconception/[R√©f√©rentiel g√©n√©ral d'√©coconception de services num√©riques (RGESN)]

Additional rules were shared by https://greenspector.com/[Greenspector].

We tried to apply these rules to each supported language, so we maintain a matrix to follow the current state of development.
xref:rules-techno-support-matrix.adoc[Here are the selected rules] currently available on ecoCode.

== Conditions for a rule to be applicable

The rules included in a SonarQube plugin are applied through a static analysis of the code.
This limits what rules can be included in the plugins.

To be applicable, a rule must follow these conditions:

* It must be statically detectable.
* It must be easily scriptable and return a boolean response (true/false).
* It must be validated (by a collective of experts AND/OR by a research thesis or appointed researcher AND/OR by a measurement tool AND/OR by a published article).
