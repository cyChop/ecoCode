ecoCode is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level.
The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware," shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

ecoCode is based on evolving catalogs of xref:rules:index.adoc[rules], for various technologies.
xref:sonarqube-plugins.adoc[SonarQube plugins] then implement these catalogs as rules for scanning your projects.

[CAUTION]
This is still a very early-stage project.
Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated.
Please refer to the contribution section.
