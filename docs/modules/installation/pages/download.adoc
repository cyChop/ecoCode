= ðŸ›’ Installing ecoCode

The main way to install ecoCode plugins is <<install.marketplace,through your SonarQube Marketplace>>.
However, it is also possible to download them from GitHub releases.

[[install.marketplace]]
== Install from Marketplace

. In your SonarQube interface, go under menu:Administration[Marketplace].
. Search for "_ecoCode_".
. Click btn:[Install] on the wanted lines.

[[install.github-release]]
== Manually install a GitHub release

. <<install.github-release.locations,Find a download>> the desired GitHub release.
. Place the obtained file in `<sonarqube-home>/extensions/plugins`.
. Restart the server.

[[install.github-release.locations]]
=== GitHub releases locations

Historically, all ecoCode plugins were hosted in a single repository.
In December 2023, we split it into one repository per plugin.

Thus, depending on the version you want, you may need to check one repository or the other.
